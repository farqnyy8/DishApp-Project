# DishApp-Project

In this project, I developed a tool that can help a chef organize the Dishes (class: <b>Dish</b>) in a directory (class: <b>DishDirectory</b>).

A user can do the following:
<ol>
<li>Add a dish and its ingredients
<li>Remove a dish
<li>View all dishes
</ol>

P.S. I am still working on this project and adding additional features.
